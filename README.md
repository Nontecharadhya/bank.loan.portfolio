Under the guidance of @Swpanjeet S

Our project's goal is to track the health of Loan Portfolio ,uncover trends that can guide our leading strategies ,and offer insights into important  loan-related
metrics and how they change over time to support data driven decision making.

Dashboard 1.𝐒𝐔𝐌𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐘

Key Performance indicators that we tracked included the total number of loan application ,the total funded amount ,the total number received,the average intersest
rate and the average debt-to-incomme (DTI).Furthermore ,we categories loans into "Good loan" and "Bad loan" according to particular loan status standards. In order
to support data-driven decision making our objective is to produce an extensive grid view report that is categorized by "Loan Status" and employs a range of chart types 
to graphically depict important loan-related metrics and trends.
